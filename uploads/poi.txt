the decodder takesthe encoded data and reconstructs the data back to its form.
the goal of the decoder is to decode as closely as the reduced latent state
-applications of autoencoders
dimensionality reduction: autoencoders can be used for reducing the dimesionality of data similar ro PCA
image denoising
anomaly reduction
What is the need of autoencoders?
Autoencoders are the vital tool for the efficient training of model as it reduces the datasets to their lowest latent space
